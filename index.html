    <h1 style="font-size:30px;">Data Visualization Example</h1>
    <p>The example of data visualizaton I chose was called "The Voting Habits of Americans Like You" by the New York Times. This visualization showed the breakdown of percentages of voters based on different demographic identifiers, such as race, gender,
        education level, state, and age. It did a great job making the ata visually appealing by representing groups of people with different colorful dots on a graph of percent Democratic and percent voter turnout. Size of the dots represented the size
        of a certain group, and each race was represented by a different color. This created a simple way to view complex and large amounts fo data in a visually appealing and colorful way. As more and more identifiers were added to the graph, it became
        easier and easier to see general trends in the data because you could see big groups of a certain color in a certain section of the graph, which would tell you something about the way a certain population voted.</p>
